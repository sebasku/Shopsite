#Shopsite

1/08/2022 I decided that I would rewrite this project using Java in a few weeks.

The project is not finished. Currently:

As a user: can create an account and log in to add stuff to the cart

As an employee(access to whole admin panel): 

	Employee has full access to the admin panel(view/modify/create/delete user/product), but can't modify stuff that comes from another employee.

As a moderator(access to part of admin panel): 

	Moderator can view/modify/create/delete only stuff that he has access to.

TODO: 

	Functionality: user profiles finish ordering

	Design: throw away media queries and implement bootstrap or something similar (earlier I used media queries simply to test how it works)

	Code: add comments change "Item/s" to "Product/s" to match how it is in the database should rewrite the whole code to OOP
