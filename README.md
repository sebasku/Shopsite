# Shopsite
Project not finished. 
Currently:

As a user:
	can create account and login
		add stuff to cart

As a employee(access to whole admin panel):
	Employee has full access to admin panel(view/modify/create/delete user/product), but can't modify stuff that comes from other employee.
  
As a moderator(access to part of admin panel):
	Moderator can view/modify/create/delete only stuff that he has access to.
  
TODO:
functionality:
  user profiles
  finish ordering

design:
  throw away mediaqueries and implement bootstrap or something similar
  (earlier I used mediaqueries simply to test how it works)

code:
  add comments
  change "Item/s" to "Product/s" to match how it is in database
  should rewrite whole code to OOP

I decided that in a few weeks I will rewrite this project using Java.
